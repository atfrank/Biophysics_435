    "    * Complete this notebook to generate a 3D ensemble of the T4 lysozyme (T4L) protein. \n",

    "        * Experimental chemical shifts: ```data/proteins/measured_shifts.dat```\n",
    "        * Computed (simulated) chemical shifts: ```data/proteins/computed_shifts.dat```\n",
    "            * The computed chemical shifts were estimated from 3D coordinates of 12 simulated structures of T4L using the tool [Larmor$^{C\\alpha}$](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct5009125).\n",
    "        * Chemical shift uncertainity: ```data/proteins/uncertainity.dat```\n",
    "        * Structures:\n",
    "            * All native NMR structure of the native T4L: ```data/proteins/3dmv_all_atom.pdb and 3dmv_coarse_grained.pdb``` (only CA atoms)\n",
    "            * Coarsed native NMR structure of the native T4L: ```data/proteins/3dmv_coarse_grained.pdb``` (only CA atoms)\n",

    "    1. Read in chemical shift data and output BME-formatted files.\n",
    "    2. Determine the best $\\theta$ value to use for BME reweighting.\n",
    "    3. For the best $\\theta$ value, plot or list the weights of each conformer.\n",

    "* **Question**:\n",
    "    * How did you choose $\\theta$?\n",
    "    * How does the **highest** weighted structure compare to the native T4L structure? If not similar, what are some possible reasons. For this analysis you will have to use a molecular viewer should as [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/) or [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) or [Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) or [NGLView](https://github.com/nglviewer/nglview) to view and compare the structures (see above).\n",
